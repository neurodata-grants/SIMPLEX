## SIMPLEX Reporting

Each month we owe a monhtly report to SIMPLEX. On the 3rd, 6th, 9th, and 12th months we also owe them a quarterly report. At the end of each Phase, we also owe them a Phase report. The process of compiling the reports is somewhat of a tedious one, but can be made easier if we give people clear instructions. Below is my recommended format for compiling monthly reports, with minor tweaks for quarterly and phase reports at the end.

1. setup a meeting 1-week before the deadline and provide food.
2. prior to the meeting, create a copy of the previous month's report into the new report file in google docs.
3. Give everyone participating access to "suggest" changes to the document.
4. Instruct people to read what they wrote in the previous month, and replace it with their new progress and content.
5. Also instruct people to add to the bibliography at the end of the document presentations given and publications they had accepted in the current month.
6. When everyone is done, proof read the document, remove all sections which were unchanged, and ask people to fix equations and things if they do latex notation in the google doc.

For quarterly and monthly reports:

1. Once the group finishes the monthtly report, stack all monthly reports within the window and save as a separate document.
