\subsection{RerF}


Your content here. Please make sure that it fits on one page.

RerF is now working in pure R code.  The running time of this implementation is roughly the same as the Matlab implementation for various sizes of input.  We are re-implementing portions of the code in both C and FlashR in an attempt to reduce the running time of the algorithm.
