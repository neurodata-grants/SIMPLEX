%% April
%
%Some timing tests were conducted to determine which methods/functions
%contribute the most to processing time, see figure
%\ref{fig:medaTimeTest}.  The figure implies that attention should be
%given to \verb+Hgmm+ which is our current implmentation of hierarchical
%Gaussian mixture models. 
%Other work on MEDA this month has been mostly devoted to creating a docker
%container and shifting the code base to be cloud friendly. 
%A development version is  now available on
%\href{https://hub.docker.com/r/neurodata/meda/}{Docker Hub}.  
%This will allow processing of data with meda to be deployed in the cloud.

%% May

A docker container
\href{https://hub.docker.com/r/neurodata/synaptograms/}{https://hub.docker.com/r/neurodata/synaptograms/}
has been developed to view multi-channel
muti-dimensional image data.  Array tomography (AT) provides a good
use-case. AT data consist of (3+$c$)-dimensional data, where $c$ is the
number of features/channels collected. 
%
A putative synapse location corresponds to an 11x11x11
pixel cube in the image and this cube will have multiple corresponding
channels. These channels can express the presence or absence of a
certain protein marker such as Synapsin or VGlut2.

\caption{
  Using a synapse detection algorithm we believe that there is a synapse
  at this location.  The location is defined by an 11x11x11 cube with 11
  feature channels. Each row of the figure corresponds to the cube over
  a specific feature channel.  The cube has been splayed out in the
  z-direction over the columns. The far right column corresponds to the
  sum statistic of each row.  This plot enables viewing of an
  11x11x11x$c$ object nicely on screen, where $c$ in this case happens
  to be 11.
