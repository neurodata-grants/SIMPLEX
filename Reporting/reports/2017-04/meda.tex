%% April

Work on MEDA this month has been mostly devoted to creating a docker
container and shifting the code base to be cloud friendly. 
A development version is  now available on
\href{https://hub.docker.com/r/neurodata/meda/}{Docker Hub}.  
This will allow processing of data with meda to be deployed in the cloud.
