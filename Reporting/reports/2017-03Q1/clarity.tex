\subsection{CLARITY}

\subsubsection{A low-latency pipeline for processing CLARITY data in the cloud}

We are working on migrating our exisiting CLARITY pipeline to run entirely on virtualized infrastructure in the cloud.
This workflow includes ingesting into ndstore, aligning to a reference atlas, and storing a registered stack back into ndstore.
Currently, ndstore is working the cloud, with manual ingest of data.
The next steps are to deploy LDDMM via Docker containers to run within the cloud environment.
