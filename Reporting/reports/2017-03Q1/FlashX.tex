\subsection{FlashX}

We advance the functions in FlashR for exploratory analysis on a billion-scale
graph. This includes functions for filtering data points and plotting
histograms and heatmaps on billions of data points. Figure \ref{fig:FlashX}
shows the in-degree histogram of vertices in the page graph and a heatmap
that indicates the distribution of the vertices of the page graph in
a two-dimension space.

	the page graph in a two-dimension space. The coordinates of the vertices
	in the two-dimension space is determined by the first left and right
	singular vector.}
