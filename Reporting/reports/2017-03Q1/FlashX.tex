\subsection{FlashX}

We advance FlashR for exploratory analysis on a billion-scale
graph. This includes functions for filtering data points and plotting
histograms and heatmaps on billions of data points. Figure \ref{fig:FlashX}
shows an example of plotting the in-degree histogram of vertices in the page
graph and a heatmap for the distribution of the vertices of the page graph in
a two-dimension space.

	in the two-dimension space is determined by the first left and right
	singular vectors.}
