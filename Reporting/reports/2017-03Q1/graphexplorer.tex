\subsection{Graph Explorer}
%We are building graph explorer as a first step towards modifying MEDA for graphs.  
%The graph explorer now has new ability to view statistics conditional on the attributes in the graph, see figure~\ref{fig:graphExplorer}. The conditional distributions illustrate
%the similarity and distinction among the different vertices in the
%network data. Difference among these distributions are potentially
%linked to their different functions in physiology.
%Graph explorer is available at \url{http://shiny.neurodata.io/lduan/graphX/}.
