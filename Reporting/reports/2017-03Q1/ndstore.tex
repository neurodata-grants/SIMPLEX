%Your content here. Please make sure that it fits on one page.
The autoingest and propagate service in ndstore were modified so they could now be deployed on the cloud. ndstore is now capable of ingesting data directly into AWS S3, an object store, using a single thread. Similarly, a scaling resolution can now be built for all the image and annotation data on AWS S3. This will support easier ingest of data from collaborators.
