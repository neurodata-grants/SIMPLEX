%Through the use of AWS Batch, a cloud deployment script has been added to the pipeline which enables users to run the
%pipeline in the cloud directly on data also stored in the cloud. This additional feature significantly lowers the
%barrier to entry for use of the pipeline, and enables researchers to process and store their data without requiring
%physical compute or data storage hardware or management expertise in house. Figure \ref{fig:ndmgcloud} shows an example
%workflow that could be used by researchers performing a study.

%\caption{\textbf{ndmg usage workflow}. The ndmg pipeline has been designed to minimize the technological equipment and
%expertise required to go from raw imaging data to scientific analyses. Here we suggest an example workflow which
%researchers can follow to accomplish this. After collecting multimodal MR (M3R) data for a study, the data can be
%organized in accordance with the BIDS organization standard and stored in Amazon S3. Once in the cloud, through the use
%of Amazon Batch and the ndmg pipeline's \texttt{ndmg\_cloud} routine, a series of parallel jobs can be launched which
%process all of the uploaded data and return the derivatives to the cloud. Along with quality control figures and
%measures, the derivatives are then retrievable by the researcher to perform further analysis.}
