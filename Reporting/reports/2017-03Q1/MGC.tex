\subsection{Multiscale Generalized Correlation (MGC)}

We developed the Multiscale Generalized Correlation method to better detect associations between two datasets $X$ and $Y$. We demonstrate that Oracle MGC is a consistent test statistic (power converge to 1 as sample size increases) under standard regularity conditions, is equivalently to the global correlation under linear dependency (i.e., each observation $X_i$ is a linear transformation of $Y_i$), and can be strictly better than the global correlation under common nonlinear dependencies. Thus Oracle MGC dominates the global correlation, and the sample MGC (i.e., choose the optimal scale by p-value map approximation, as the testing power are not available in the absence of the true model and training data) also empirically dominates the global correlation. A flowchart to illustrate the advantage of MGC is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:all}.

Upon final draft polishing and addressing feedback from statisticians and biologists, the newest draft is updated to \href{https://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.05148.pdf}{arXiv} and submitted for publication.
