\subsection{knor: K-means NUMA Optimized Routines}

We previously described the \textsf{knor} library. As a set of tools enabling
users to perform the popular k-means algorithm at scale at speeds of 10x-100x
time of that of popular frameworks in use today like Spark's MLlib, H$^2$O
and GraphLab(Turi, Dato).

We would like to report that our \textsf{knor} paper that was submitted
to the ACM Symposium on High-Performance Parallel and Distributed Computing (HPDC 2017)
and publicly released it to \href{https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.08905}{arxiv}
was \textbf{accepted} for publication to the 26th proceedings of HPDC.
