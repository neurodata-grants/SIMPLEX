\subsection{ndreg}

We received three new CLARITY image volumes from our colleagues at Stanford University. 
Each dataset contained two channels of a single mouse brain hemisphere at a 585 $\mu m$ $\times$ 585 $\mu m$ $\times$ 5000 $\mu m$ resolution.
The images were ingested and propagated to lower resolutions using NeuroData infrastructure.
NeuroData's registration module (ndreg) was then used to register each image to the Allen institute's mouse Reference Atlas (ARA).

First each image was reoriented to the ARA, the background was subtracted and a mask was generated to eliminate bright regions.
After affine alignment, each Stanford image was deformably aligned to the ARA through Large Deformation Diffeomorphic Metric Mapping (LDDMM).
Since the ARA and CLARITY images differed greatly in intensity profile, mutual information matching was adopted during this step.
Alignment was done in a 3-step multi-resolution approach, with registration at coarser scales initializing the alignment at subsequent finer scales.
It was clear from the ARA-CLARITY checkerboard composite images that registration proceeded successfully (Figure~\ref{fig:ndregAiley}).
