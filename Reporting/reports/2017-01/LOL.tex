\subsection{LOL}



As you may recall from last month, we successfully proved that LOL outperforms PCA essentially always when performing a linear dimensionality reduction prior to classification.  This month we generate simulation results supporting those theoretical claims (see Figure \ref{fig:LOL}).

LOL outperforms other linear classifiers in a wide variety of settings, including those for which we have proven LOL should (rows 1 and 3), and those beyond our current theoretical grasp (rows 2, 4, and 5). This is true regardless of the dimensionality into which we embed.
