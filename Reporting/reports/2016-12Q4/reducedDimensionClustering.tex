\subsection{Reduced Dimension Clustering}

We develop a new statistical method, named ``automatic repulsive
clustering'' (ARC, to handle the clustering problem when the
dimensionality outgrows the number of the data points. The standard
dimension reduction tool such as principle component analysis (PCA) is
not optimal for finding the subspace best suitable for clustering.
Therefore, we seek the method to do dimension reduction and clustering
at the same time: we develop a regularization to encourage good
separation of the clusters, forcing the subspace to an angle so that
each point can belong to a cluster completely. The plots below shows the
different performances in clustering a equally proportioned 3
components: the subspace found by PCA leads to incorrect clustering of
the data, due to the orientation of the space; whereas ARC successfully
identifies the ideal clustering direction in one dimensional space,
hence generating satisfactory clustering result.
