% \section{Cost Summary}

% \emph{Provide a cost estimate for resources over the proposed timeline of the project, broken down by year. Include labor, materials, a list of deliverables and delivery schedule. Provide cost estimates for each subcontractor (may be a rough order of magnitude).}

% Each of the three co-I's will request $\$200$K per year, to cover one month salary, one post-doctoral fellow, minor equipment, some travel, and overhead.  The prime will request an additional five months of support, and a graduate student, for an additional $100$K per year.  Equipment costs for new computational capabilities will amount to approximately $100$K per year. Thus, the total annual cost will be about \$1M.
