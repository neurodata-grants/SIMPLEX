\section{Schedule and Milestones}
\label{sec:milestones}

% \emph{Provide a detailed schedule showing tasks (task name, duration, work breakdown structure element as applicable, performing organization), milestones, and the interrelationships among tasks. The task structure must be consistent with that in the SOW. Measurable milestones should be clearly articulated and defined in time relative to the start of the project.}

Figure \ref{fig:milestones} provides the list of milestones organized by time and task.  Please see \S \ref{sec:sow} for details.

\caption[Schematic listing all milestones for this proposal.]{Schematic listing all milestones for this proposal.  Black elements of this array denote quarters during which the work for that specific subtask will be completed.  Deliverables will be delivered in the final quarter for the subtasks.  Key milestone for each task in each phase correspond to the names of those tasks in \S \ref{sec:sow}, and \S \ref{sec:tech} lists all subtasks.  For Task 5 (bottom rows), the number of 'X's per element denotes the number of times the reports will be generated and sent.}
